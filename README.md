# An Analysis of Post-5 P.M. Step Counts - Remote vs. Traditional Work

## Situation
The project aims to understand how different work environments (remote vs. traditional in-person work) influence physical activity levels, specifically focusing on step counts post-5 P.M. 

## Task
•	Analyze and compare daily step counts post-5 P.M. in remote and traditional work settings.
•	Responsibilities include collecting step count data, data cleaning, and statistical analysis.

## Action
•	Collected daily step count data for a year, with participants experiencing both remote and traditional work environments.
•	Conducted a detailed analysis of step counts post-5 P.M. for both work settings.
•	Applied appropriate statistical methods to compare and understand the differences in physical activity levels in the two settings.

## Result
The study aims to provide insights into how work environment affects physical activity, specifically steps taken post-5 P.M. The findings could inform workplace policies and individual health strategies, emphasizing the importance of activity in different work settings.

## Reflection
This project highlights the potential of data-driven insights in understanding lifestyle impacts due to work environments. It underscores the importance of considering work settings in health and wellness strategies and can guide future research to include other factors such as age, gender, or type of occupation.

# Comparing Male and Female Groups Daily Step Counts
This project aims to conduct a statistical analysis using an independent-sample t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the average daily step count between males and females. This will be achieved by processing and analyzing step count data from the Apple Health app within a 9-month timeframe.

## Situation

The increasing availability of health and fitness data through applications like Apple's Health app provides a unique opportunity to understand physical activity patterns across different demographics. This project leverages Apple Health data to analyze daily step counts, aiming to uncover gender-based trends and contribute to public health knowledge.

## Task

I will perform a detailed comparative analysis of step count data, focusing on gender differences. My responsibilities include data cleaning, preparing datasets for analysis, conducting the t-test, and interpreting the results.

## Action 

Utilizing the Apple Health application's data, I executed the following steps:
* Seperated the data by gender to define independent groups for analysis.
* Calculated average daily steps for each gender group.
* Performed an independent-samples t-test to evaluate the significance of the observed differences.
* Analyzed the t-test results.

## Result

The analysis concluded statistically significant insights into the step count differences by gender, which could inform public health initiatives and personal fitness programs. 

## Reflection

This project shows the potential of using everyday technology for large-scale health data analysis and how it can influence public health decisions. It will also highlights my analytical skills, particularly in statistical methods and health data interpretation. For future projects, I aim to incorporate more variables, such as age and BMI, to create a more comprehensive understanding of physical activity patterns.
